    "Notes on imperative form of verbs:": "Rules for Forming the Imperative\nSecond Person Singular (ty):\nThe imperative for \"you\" (singular, informal) is often formed by taking the base form of the verb and adding the ending:\nFor most verbs, drop the infinitive ending (-ć or -ić).\nAdd the appropriate ending (often no additional ending for -e/-a verbs, e.g., mówić → mów! or robić → rób!).\nExamples:\nMów! (Speak!)\nJedz! (Eat!)\nBądź! (Be!)\nSecond Person Plural (wy):\nAdd the suffix -cie to the base form.\nExamples:\nMówcie! (Speak! - plural)\nJedzcie! (Eat! - plural)\nFirst Person Plural (my):\nUse the ending -my, often translated as \"let's [do something].\"\nExamples:\nChodźmy! (Let's go!)\nZróbmy! (Let's do!)\nThird Person Singular and Plural:\nThe imperative for third persons uses the subjunctive with niech (let him/her/it/them).\nExamples:\nNiech mówi! (Let him/her speak!)\nNiech jedzą! (Let them eat!)\nPolite Commands (Second Person Singular Formal):\nUse the third person singular with proszę to form polite requests.\nExamples:\nProszę otworzyć okno! (Please open the window!)\nNegative Imperative\nTo negate an imperative, simply add nie before the verb:\nNie mów! (Don’t speak!)\nNie róbcie! (Don’t do it! - plural)"
